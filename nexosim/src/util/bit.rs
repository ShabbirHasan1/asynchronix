//! Bit manipulation and algorithms.

/// Find the position of the `Nᵗʰ` set bit starting the search from the least
/// significant bit.
///
/// A rank `N=1` specifies the first set bit starting from the LSB, a rank `N=2`
/// specifies the second set bit starting from the LSB, etc.
///
/// The rank is to be provided as a closure that takes as argument the total
/// number of set bits in the value (same as `value.count_ones()`). The rank
/// returned by the closure should therefore never be greater than the closure's
/// argument.
///
/// The returned position is 0-based. If the bit to be found is the LSB, or if
/// the provided rank is 0, the returned position is 0. If in turn the bit to be
/// found is the MSB, or if the specified rank is strictly greater than the
/// total number of bits set, the returned position is `usize::BITS - 1`.
///
/// It is recommended to check for zero values before calling this function
/// since the returned position is then meaningless regardless of the rank.
///
/// Implementation notes: the implementation is based on a tree-of-adders
/// algorithm followed by binary search, with overall theoretical complexity
/// `O(log(usize::BITS))`. In release mode the function is optimized to fully
/// branchless code with a pretty moderate cost of about 70 instructions on
/// x86-64 and less than 60 instruction on aarch64, independently of the inputs.
/// The use of the `popcnt` intrinsic was also investigated to compute sub-sums
/// in the binary search but was found to be slower than the tree-of-adders.
